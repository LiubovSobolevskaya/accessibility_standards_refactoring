# Accessibility Standards Refactoring


This is the challenge for the first week of the UCB Bootcamp, where we will be working on improving an existing HTML and CSS document to comply with accessibility standards. The goal is to ensure that the changes made do not affect the visual appearance of the page.

In this challenge, we aim to address the following questions:

* What are accessibility standards and why are they important?
* What are semantic HTML elements?
* What is an accessible alt attribute?
* What are heading attributes and what sequential order do they fall in?
* What is a title element and what is it intended to describe?
